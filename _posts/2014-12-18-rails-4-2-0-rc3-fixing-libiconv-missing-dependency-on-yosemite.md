  title: Rails 4.2.0.rc3 - Fixing libiconv missing dependency on OSX 10.10 (Yosemite)
---

OK, so today I tried to install the newest <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/12/13/Rails-4-2-0-rc3-has-been-released/">release candidate</a> of Rails - the <code>4.2.0.rc3</code> and *again*, I got the missing <code>libiconv</code> dependency error while installing nokogiri, version 1.6.5.

<pre>
ERROR:  Error installing nokogiri:

libiconv is missing.  Please locate mkmf.log to investigate how it is failing.

I headed back to official <a href="http://www.nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri website</a> and reviewed their <a href="http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html">installation guidelines</a>, which basically say that on OS X it should work out of the box, _unless_ you encounter the <code>libiconv</code> issues ;).

But still, they claim that the following should do the trick:

<pre>
% brew unlink gcc-4.2 # you might not need this step
% gem uninstall nokogiri
% xcode-select --install
% gem install nokogiri
</pre>

Unfortunately that did not work for me, so I started investigating further.

I tried the solution from my <a href="http://blog.sailsoftware.co/2014/09/05/upgrading-rails-to-4-2-0-beta1-on-mavericks.html">previous blog post</a>, which fixed the problem before by passing the additional parameter for non-standard iconv installations:

<pre>
gem install nokogiri --with-iconv-include=/usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.14/include \ 
  --with-iconv-lib=/usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.14/lib
</pre>

with no success, but really I wanted to get it working cleanly this time, without the custom steps and/or hacks involved.

### Unlink the libiconv at brew!

So what\'s the deal here? With up-to-date Xcode developer tools installed, iconv actually installed at <code>/usr/bin/iconv</code> and still failing to install by pointing to the brew version of <code>libiconv</code>, I tried to <strong>unlink the libiconv</strong> at brew and finally got it working as expected!

So please find the actual steps I took, below:

<pre>
# install the latest ruby 2.1.5
% rvm install ruby-2.1.5
% brew unlink libiconv
Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.14... 125 symlinks removed

% gem install nokogiri # you can skip it and and go directly to installing rails of course
% gem install rails â€”version 4.2.0.rc3
% rails -v
Rails 4.2.0.rc3
</pre>

Nice and clean now, rockin\' on a bleeding edge of Rails again :)
