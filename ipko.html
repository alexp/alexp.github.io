  Online banking for the largest Polish Bank - PKO Bank Polski.
</h1>

<p>
  For this project, I joined a team of 30+ devs, anlysts and testers at
  <strong><a href="http://bluesoft.net.pl/">Bluesoft</a></strong>, Warsaw,
  to work on the last iteration of the online banking
  system used by bank customers to manage their private
  and corporate finance online.
</p>

<p>
  I've implemented numerous functionalities, fixes &amp; change requests
  according to requirements specification, often interchanging between
  frontend Javascript based <strong>Backbone/Marionette</strong> development and backend
  <strong>Python</strong> coding.
</p>

<p>
  We've worked in small teams, practiced <strong>Continous
  Integration</strong>, code reviews and significantly covered
  our code with unit tests.
