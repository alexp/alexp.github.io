    Wayfinder - Frontend &amp; Backend
</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Wayfinder</strong> - shortest route finding
    system for shopping malls, hospitals, public
    facilities and alike.
</p>

<p>
    I was brought on board this project, by a fantastic team of specialists from
    <a href="http://silksoftwarehouse.com/">Silk Software House</a> in order to
    help them build a white label, shortest route finding software.
    First, I've created a frontend prototype, as a proof of concept of the solution
    to test out the initial ideas we had.
    We then took the lessons learned from that and reiterated,
    building a fully functioning system. The software supports
    route finding and dynamic presentation between multiple floors
    and comes with a management interface that allows the users to edit
    the paths, maps, floors and venues.
</p>

<p>
    The end product was deployed in the largest shopping mall,
    downtown Warsaw -
    <a href="http://zlotetarasy.pl/en/centremap">ZÅ‚ote Tarasy</a> -
    as a web-based solution on the shopping malls website and on premises,
    inside the touchscreen hardware.
