          Below, you'll find a short summary of my latest ventures:
          <p>
            <h4>Appsinth Software House</h4>
            I am a cofounder of a small Warsaw-based software agency called <a href="http://appsinth.pl/">Appsinth</a>.
            We create web and mobile based applications and provide consulting services.
            Our latest creation is <a href="http://kanei.pl/">Kanei</a> - a platform where Polish business coaches can easily sell their services and products online.

            Before that, for two years, I worked as a technical project manager for <a href="http://activeweb/">Activeweb</a>, creating innovative solutions for medical sector and big pharma industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Backend Systems</h4>
            Until recently, I was on the core team at <a href="http://superpaczka.pl">superpaczka.pl</a>, which is a reasonably successful, polish parcel broker. We've worked as a team of 5 (plus 3 customer service officers) since day one of the 
            startup company, and have continued to evolve the product for nearly two years. My job was to design, develop and maintain the backend system together with a DB specialist. <!-- I wrote an essay on the things that I learned during this time. You can <a href="">read it here</a> -->
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Freelancing</h4>
            I mainy work as a freelance software developer. Lately, I've shipped <a href="http://animacja.org/">this website</a>, driven by a custom-crafted backend written in Ruby On Rails.
            Among others, I also designed, implemented and now maintain the website of <a href="http://hermanowa-wola.pl/">this beautiful farmhouse in Poland</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Open Source</h4>
            Some of my sideprojects are hosted at <a href="https://github.com/alexp">github.com/alexp</a>. I will be uploading some of my recent works very soon. Stay tuned.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Commercial side-projects</h4>
            I strongly belive in initiative and enterpreneurship. I love building buisnesses that work. Lately, I have 
            created <a href="http://gearreef.com/">GearReef</a> - a simple recommendation website containing the best outdoor gear available on the market.
            Right now, I am working on <a href="http://vinyasa.io">Vinyasa</a>, a modern, minimalistic, yet powerful content management system.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Travel &amp; Adventure</h4>
            I love travel &amp; adventure. I sail as often as possible, windsurf, climb, 
            dive and do all kinds of other exciting stuff, when I'm on the road. 
            
            Here's some of my favourite footage:

            <br />
            <br />

            Currently I travel around South East Asia, working remotely from some of the most 
            beautiful beaches in the world. I post some of my experiences, here &amp; on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96864643@N08/">flickr</a>.
            We also post some of our thoughts and pictures on our travel blog <a href="http://airseasummit.com/">Air, Sea & Summit</a>.
