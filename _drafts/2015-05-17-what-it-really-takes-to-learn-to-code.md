  title: What it really takes to learn to code? <br/><span class='text-small'>.. and how do I start?</span>
---

In my spare time I've been involved in mentoring a couple of people with little
to no prior programming experience. Since I've had the initial conversiation
on "how do I start learning how to program" or "how do I get a junior programming
job or internship" more than once, I thought I'd write here about my take on it
and what I generally tend to tell people when they ask about it.

<h2>Who's this post for?</h2>

In general, I wrote it for people who are **seriously** considering getting
into programming either as a hobby or to get an entry level job or an
internship at some point. Now, you won't become a coder overnight, but
investing your time and effort is worthwhile, I can promise you that.

<h2>TD;DR</h2>

**\<tl-dr\>**<br/>
  Some of the many options to start out is starting with a tutorial
  on programming like the briliant <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">Learn
  Ruby The Hard Way</a> or <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>.
  After that, building a simple webapp with the help of an application
  framework like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a>,
  <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> or
  <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> by following one of the
  abundant tutorials on one of these technologies listed <a href="#technologies">here</a>. It's perfectly fine if
  you're confused about what choices to make.
  If so, go <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">here</a> and start learning Ruby.
  Then start building a simple app following <a
  href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">The Rails Tutorial</a>. You really can't go wrong here.
  Numerous people have proven that Ruby and Rails are viable choices and both are a lot
  of fun to learn.

<h2>Am I too dumb to program a computer?</h2>

In short, **NO, you're not**. But before we go any further though, we must establish
a rough baseline.

While I belive that you *can* learn to program without prior knowledge,
if you're serious about learning to code, it's still important to know the basics
of computing and hardware architecture. You don't have to know the internals
and mechanics of how computers work from top to bottom, but general working
knowledge of using and interacting with a computer is kind of obligatory.

In this article, I am assuming that you have good working knowledge of using computers
and generally understand the technology stack. If you can barely tell apart
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">browser</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">internet</a>,

and the <a href="http://pc.net/helpcenter/answers/memory_and_hard_disk_space">difference</a>
between the two, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">windows</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">linux</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS">macs</a>,
etc, you might want to check out those basics first.

Some very good books have been written on the subject and these include:

* <a href="http://www.fastchip.net/howcomputerswork/p1.html">HOW COMPUTERS WORK</a> by Roger Young
* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a>
* .. and a whole bunch available *for free* at <a href="http://freecomputerbooks.com/compscHardwareBooks.html">freecomputerbooks.com</a>

There are also some very good video resources out there, like the very popular
<a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a> from Harvard University.

So, having that long intro behind us, let's start with the actual things you
should consider when planning your learning strategy.


<h1>Have fun</h1>

While it might be quite intimidating at first, you'll soon realize
that it can actually be a lot of fun.
The fact that pretty quickly, you could be building something useful or
entertaining is really compelling. The sheer idea, that you could just
build something, out of absolutely nothing, show it to others and recieve
feedback is a very empowering thing to think about in the context of programming.

<h1>Work hard</h1>

First of all, prepare to work hard. Be ready to put in the hours of work,
study, sometimes periods of frustration and many times awe and fullfillment.
Programming a computer is just not the easiest things you can learn.
It's very rewarding, but it's a nontrivial task. I can't stress enough how
self motivation is important here. I've seen many people quit after being
stuck on some problem for a while or who were just not prepared to work that
hard. It's not that obvious. You really have to find the motivation to keep going,
and not many people stress that enough. You need to hussle and push through it.
Having said that, it's not as difficult as it seems at first and now is truly the
best time to start. It really has never been easier to learn to code.
The amount of tools, resources, knowledge, examples, open data and so on are
so abundant that it makes my brain hurt. Use that.
Capitalize on virtually all the human knowledge that just sits on you laptop.
We live in truly empowering times when it comes to knowledge and technical
skills and it's almost your duty to humanity to use that opportunity well!

<h1>Make it relevant & think big</h1>

Make the programming experience relevant and fun to <strong>you</strong>.
Definitely start small, but also start with a bigger picture idea about
what you could possibly be able to bring to life if only you could know how to
code it. Relevance and well defined goals are key to success.
Make your goals achievable, but be bold on your vision to retain motivation.

<h1>Be proactive</h1>

This is a huge one and really touches the subject of mentors as well.
Being proactive is reaching out to find the knowledge and foundation
out there. Also it means coming up with your own little projects and
problems to work on. Seeking your areas of interest basically.
Use <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> intensly,
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>, plain old google,
social media, newsgroups and irc channels. Ask questions but be prepared
to put the work into research by yourself instead of recieving ready solutions.

<h1>Seek out mentors</h1>

This one is actually most beneficial if you have a little knowledge already,
but I'll still mention it because I think that this is not emphasized
enough in most of the resources out there.

If you're just starting out, just get on it and do your research
as you go along. You can find my starting point recommendations
at the <a href="#why-rails">bottom of this post</a>.

Having mentors is one of the crutial steps on the path to mastery.
Most successful people of this world claim they had a mentor and
as an aspiring programer you should consider finding your mentors as well.
After you dive in and start to get the main ideas and more importantly -
start to realize what you don't know yet (which is almost everything), start
reading famous programmers' books and code and seek out more experienced people
in your area. Real world interaction with smarter and more senior hackers
will be very influential and will make you progress faster.

There are many resources out there, that will be far more comprehensive that I
wish this post would be. For starters, check out
<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/recommended-reading-for-developers/">Jeff
Atwoods' Recommended Reading for Developers</a>.

<h1>Stay hungry</h1>

The process of learning never really ends. It sounds trivial, but it's true.
Stay hungry for knowledge and keep improving. Take on harder and harder tasks.
Once you learn something new, you start to see how it unfolds a new rabbithole
of further questions and ideas. Keep going deeper and remember that mastery is a constant progress.
Like with most hard things, it's a marathon, not a sprint.

<h1>So How do I start already?</h1>

Ok, preaching aside, how do you actually start?

First of all, although many people would probabily disagree,
you don't have to become a computer scientist in order to create software.
I wouldn't go down the road of reading tons of theory books before trying
to write simple programs first. Many successfull coders have proven, that you can just
dive in by following tutorials and start filling the knowledge gaps as
you go along and discover more about the craft.

There are really many paths to getting started and honestly I don't
think that it really matters what kind of language or framework
you choose. It doesn't really matter if you start with C, C++, Java, PHP,
Python, Ruby or Javascript. It really does not matter if you first
go to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codeadcademy</a>, <a
href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a> or <a
href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html">Become a Programmer, Motherfucker</a>.
These are all viable options and you can choose what suits you best.

I am attaching a list of noteable resources at the bottom of this post,
that you can go through.

Having said that, one of the strategies that has always worked for me is immersing
yourself in as many tutorials, articles and videos on the subject as you can
possibly can. No matter what language and/or framework you'll choose.

<h2 id="why-rails">Why Rails?</h2>

One of the viable paths you should strongly consider is going with <a
href="">Ruby language</a> and <a
href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> web application framework.

Here's why:

<h2>Simplicity</h2>

Ruby On Rails uses the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>
programming language, which is modern, easy to use and expressive.
Rails does a good job of abstracting away the complexities of
building a web application, so at the beginning of you journey you can focus on
messing around and building simple things without going deep into
techincalities. Of course, later on you'll want to dig deeper
and actually get to know the theory and engineering under the hood.
But for now, you just don't need that, as your goal is to create
something and make it publicly available.

<h2>Huge, active community</h2>

Rails has one of the most active communities of hackers and builders out there.
Most of the beginner questions can be easily found online on forums, Q&A sites
like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> blogs and mooc
courses.

<h2>Useful skill</h2>

Rails is quite popular among new and existing startups, because it
significantly cuts down the time of shipping a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable
Product</a>. It lets you quickly build a prototype of something real and go from there.

Going with Python is a viable option as well.
