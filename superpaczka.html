      - Backend</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Courier broker service</strong> - a web application that let's you send a package by ordering a delivery company to pick it up from your doorstep.

    <p>
        For this seed level startup from Warsaw, I was hired to build a backend system much needed to support everyday operations of management and customer care.
        The project was initially written in PHP and had a very scarce admin panel. We've divided the work to reimplement the frontend and backend from scratch and I took the lead for the backend and admin panel solution.
        Together with the team, we've worked out a proof-of-concept version of an administration panel, tested it out, reiterated and delivered a solid solition to monitor the orders, package statuses and customer data.<br/>
        We've integrated the software with APIs from DPD and DHL courier companies to automatically order and track the parcels. The site went from 100 to over 10000 monthly orders.
