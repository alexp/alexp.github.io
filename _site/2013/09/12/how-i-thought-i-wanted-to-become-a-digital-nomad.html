  <h1 class="title">How I thought, I wanted to become a digital nomad.</h1>
  <i>..when really I didn't.</i>
<p>Around three months ago, the company I worked for got suddenly closed.</p>

<p>The reasons for this, are quite irrelevant to this article, but in short, the investor backed out and the ongoing development of a product I was mainly involved in, had been suspended.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t plan for this scenario. The timing was off, I just came back from vacation and had had a semi long-term plans based on a stable situation with my current day job.</p>

<p>But it had happened and, practically, overnight I had to figure out my next moves for the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>The idea of working remotely has always been compelling for me. Somehow I always knew that at some point in time, I&#8217;d like to &#8220;escape the nine to five&#8221;, travel the world with my laptop, make money doing freelancing gigs, experience life to the fullest, and yet maintain the technical skills without becoming rusty.</p>

<p>And suddenly - here I was, without a lot of attachments, no mortgage, kids, with <em>some</em> savings on my account and no immediate plans for the nearest future.</p>

<p>Having said that, the decision was pretty simple - this was a great opportunity to do some traveling, that I&#8217;ve always wanted to do.</p>

<p>Choosing the location was also quite obvious and for a number of reasons I finally bought a ticket to Bangkok.</p>

<p>Southeast Asia FTW!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already done some traveling in Europe and wanted to see some other parts of the world.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent a year in States and would love to come back, but I wanted to depart as soon as possible and American visa policy is both expensive and still quite hard to get for Polish citizens.</p>

<p>Australia is just too damn expensive for longterm travel on budget, especially when, like me, you&#8217;re into scuba diving, kite surfing and numerous other outdoor activities that are generally quite pricey, even in &#8220;cheap&#8221; countries.</p>

<p>So, Southeast Asia was an obvious choice. It&#8217;s the mecca of budget travelers. There are countless blogs owned by people who work online and travel this region and, I guess, that it&#8217;s just a thing that one has to experience at least once in his or hers lifetime.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I had some minor clients that I worked for after hours when I still had a job, so while much, much smaller, some income while on the road was pretty much secured.</p>

<p>After around one month of preparations (vaccines, gear, minor planning), me and my girlfriend packed our bags (42 liter Northface Duffels - highly recommended, although not the best choice if walking long distances) and was off to Bangkok with a general idea to travel around Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia (which, by the way, we later corrected to Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia, but this is different story).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been on the road for two months now, working online for the clients back in Poland. The gigs mostly include maintaining and modifying existing websites, but I&#8217;ve lately managed to secure one larger Rails project that needs to be done from scratch.</p>

<p>So far, this has been a very rewarding, educating (although not really in the technical sense) experience, but there are some major drawbacks to this kind of lifestyle, that I&#8217;d like to share.</p>

<p>They mainly involve two recurring, significant problems that I found I was facing:</p>

<p>1) Limited types of projects, you are able to tackle while on the road;</p>

<p>2) Illusion of freedom of choice concerning your location;</p>

<h2 id='only_small_simple_projects'>Only small, simple projects</h2>

<p>This is a huge disadvantage for me. Initially I was OK with doing some minor gigs that would just keep me afloat, but the reality of this is that now, I have a constant feeling of underachievement and wasting time.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s fun to open your laptop in your bungalow on Koh Phangan, right next to a beautiful beach, chat with your client or hack around on the project, knowing that after the work is done, you&#8217;ll jump in a 30 degree (Celsius) warm waters of the Gulf of Thailand, or better yet, go free diving on numerous reefs around, but this comes with a price.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#8217;t believe that long-term travel is actually waste of time. There are numerous advantages and opportunities to grow while traveling, but you can&#8217;t have the best of both worlds all at once unfortunately.</p>

<p>If you like challenges and have the need of constant self development in your area of expertise, it&#8217;s just very hard to find the necessary balance here.</p>

<p>Of course it all depends on the kinds of projects you manage to get, and technical problems you face during implementation, but let&#8217;s be honest here - knowing that you&#8217;re on a constant move, quite often facing unpredictable internet access quality and desire to make the most out of your traveling experience you just can&#8217;t be doing some substantial, challenging work, that involves hours of analysis, discussions and complicated programming.</p>

<p>There are just too many distractors around and too much stuff to see after (and sometimes during) work.</p>

<p>I can already tell, that some people are now thinking that it&#8217;s just a matter of self-control, planning and proper preparation, but for me it never was the case.</p>

<p>I think of myself as a very self-motivated guy. My clients are happy with the work that I&#8217;m doing and I always manage to meet the agreed deadlines, while maintaining high quality standards I set for myself.</p>

<p>This is not the point. The point is, that having some significant experience on mid-sized projects, involving some non-trivial programming, I observe, that most of the kind of work I&#8217;ve been doing at my day job, would be either impossible or extremely challenging to get done while on the road.</p>

<p>This limits my options to taking only the kinds of projects that I know I&#8217;ll be able to easily handle by myself, within <em>very</em> predictable timelines and involving limited amount of research.</p>

<p>And to be completely honest, it&#8217;s just not enough. I believe that working with a team of people that are more experienced and smarter than yourself is crucial for your development, and as a freelancer, doing minor gigs involving some MVC/CRUD application programming, you just miss out on a world of possibilities to grow and learn.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong though - I keep busy, try to learn something new everyday and strive to continue to develop my skills as a programmer. For the past two months, however, I just felt I lack the exposure to real-world problems that you get to face, when on the job in an organization that everyday tackles problems way more sophisticated than you&#8217;d be able to tackle on your own. Whether it&#8217;s a small startup or a large corporation is irrelevant here.</p>

<h2 id='the_location_independence_illusion'>The location independence illusion</h2>

<p>Now, I absolutely think that working remotely <em>is</em> possible and it&#8217;s a great way for (a) developers to stay &#8220;location independent&#8221; and (b) companies to cut costs a bit, making use of available technologies.</p>

<p>The problem here is quite different though. Working on the road gives you a kind of <em>illusion of location independence</em>. While it&#8217;s true you can work for one company being physically &#8220;anywhere&#8221; in the world, in order to get some substantial amount of work done, you actually need a comfortable spot, good internet connection, peaceful environment and ideally some facilities around like a gym/yoga school park or a bar - whatever you&#8217;re into.</p>

<p>Even though it might be obvious, during my travels I found out the hard way that creative, meaningful work, requires some routine. Changing your location once a week, working from benches, hammocks, cafes, bars and hostel floors is a cool way to fund your vacation, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t help you when tackling hard programming problems.</p>

<p>Thinking about different possibilities and layers of these problems, currently I have a couple of solution ideas listed below:</p>

<p>1) get a remote-friendly job that fits your skill set and ambitions. Move every quarter or so. Stay in one place for a while. Immerse yourself in the culture and rhythm of the chosen destination, rent a nice room or apartment with a legit desk and a chair you can actually sit in for longer than 3hrs (unless you&#8217;re one of the standup-work-environments kind of guy, than forget it), get the routine going. Live somewhere you like, and when you feel like change, do some research and go for it.</p>

<p>2) get a real job, in real office, do stuff you love and challenge yourself (actually, always do that, ofc), negotiate long-term vacations and go traveling for instance, for two months every year or so (details irrelevant).</p>

<p>3) keep working on that &#8220;passive income&#8221; wordpress site and/or travel blog that makes you tons of cash and travel till you puke ;)</p>

<li>I personally dislike the &#8216;digital nomad&#8217; term. There is something inherently &#8216;douchy&#8217; about this title.</li>
